# COVID-19 Chatbot

A chatbot for the new coronavirus (COVID-19) based on frequently asked questions from the WHO. 

The WHO provides answers to frequently asked question regarding the coronavirus. This GitHub page belongs to (this) blog, in which I describe how a chatbot based on artificial intelligence works. The implementiation of the chatbot is peformed in Python with a dataset which was gathered from the WHO: https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses

On this GitHub page you can download the dataset which was used. Also, you can find the code including instructions.
